- NOTE: the time stepping and mesh density in these examples were not optimized for accuracy and speed,
  and as a result of using for a comparison study are most likely much too fine. When adapting an example 
  to your needs, I highly recommend a mesh refinement and time stepping study. In addition, the examples using
  the Multi-field solver use a single stagger iteration step with no load relaxation. This was chosen to 
  avoid previous issues with passing of variables which have since been resolved. I recommended exploring different
  stagger step sizes and maximum iterations, as this is most likely a route to faster, more accurate simulations.  

- comsol_comparison
  - the tests used in the verification study with CERN are shared, these are found documented in 
    the engineering note "verification_COMSOL_comparison_R1" in the benchmarking directory
  - some tests are duplicated with a "_CC" labeling, this is a second test with circuit coupling
    rather than current density loading
  - in the plotting routines, the "write_trans_elem_res" script needs to skip a different number of lines
    based on whether the output was generated by running ANSYS in the GUI or by batch, for the GUI the 
    second input on the readData function should be 6 for 6 skipped lines, or 14 if run in batch
    I believe most of the plotting routines are set up for batch except for Test4E,Test5D,Test6B
  - peak hotspot temperature is obtained only when running through the GUI because it uses plnsol,max
    this is important for Test4E, Test5D, and Test6B -> you can still solve in batch, but must re-run
    the postprocessing in the GUI (there is a finish.txt which will do this if resume the jobname)
  - if you would like to run in batch I included 3 batch scripts which call the tests after you set the 
    location of the test directories and your custom ANSYS.exe, to use them first rename with a .bat extension
